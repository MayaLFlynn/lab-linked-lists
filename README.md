lab-linked-lists
================

Code for a lab on implementing a simple list interface with doubly
linked lists and circular doubly linked lists.

Adding the circular linked structor allowed two special cases to be removed from add and one special case be removed from remove. This definately made thinking about special cases easier. In terms of lines of code it was about the same because there were only special cases in two of the functions, so we only got rid of about 10 lines of code. However, having fewer special cases makes the code feel shorter when writing it.
